# Challenges: Software Developer

## Challenge 1: S-expression parser

This challenge is close to what your first mission would look like working at GHGSat. This is thus a very good way for us to assess your skills, and for you to understand the software stack we are using.

Write a simple C or C++ program which:

* parses s-expression file given as input, it shall successfully parses `example.sexp`
* print on stdout each element, its data-type and value
* is built from a Makefile or CMake with x86 and ARM targets
* can run on a Raspberry Pi, or Beaglebone or ARM qemu emulator on a Linux desktop

Above items are normally listed in ascending order of complexity. It's ok not to complete all of them, make your best.

Please make your best to complete this assignment within 72h, and provide following elements with your answer:
* your source code pushed to a public repository (preferrably **not** as email attachment),
* a README.md describing how to build your project,
* some instructions how to run it on the chosen hardware or emulator environment
* a quick review how you went through this assignment: method, research, problems you faced?
* what would do to improve this software if you were given more time?

Good Luck!
